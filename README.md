# **Growth-Mindset**

Growth mindset, In a nutshell, people with growth mindsets are constantly trying to learn and grow to better themselves. These are individuals who enjoy challenges and believe that their intelligence, talents, and basic abilities can be increased or enhanced through hard work and dedicated effort.



Three reminders to keep myself in a growth mindset are challenges, obstacles and efforts. These reminders help our minds constantly monitoring the events that occur in our lives and interpret the meaning of the things that are happening. Our mindset is what dictates how we perform the tracking of these situations and how we react to what takes place.
